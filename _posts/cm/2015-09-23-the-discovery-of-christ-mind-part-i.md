Looking back over my life I recognize that I've always desired to have
experiences that could be described as 'out of the ordinary'. Why I even
thought that it would be possible to have extraordinary experiences must have
arisen from the imagination of a child.

<span id="tour-stop-h">I remember one such experience</span> when I was around
10 years old. In our house, there was a clock that chimed on the half hour and
I awoke one night to hear it begin to chime. I counted, "one, two, three ..."
all the way up to twelve. Yikes! Twelve &ndash; it was twelve o'clock, not
a good time to be up and about, and that was just what I wanted to do having
the need to visit the bathroom.

I carefully planned my course of action. First, jump out from the bed to
a distance where "the hand" would be unable to reach my ankle from under the
bed. Success! Now, take a right turn just outside the bedroom door and walk
briskly to the bathroom. But&hellip;

As I was exiting my room, I saw a strange figure &ndash; a man, with
a patchwork suit and matching hat, walking up the stairs slowly. Not my Dad,
that's for sure. Immediately I turned around and dove into bed covering my
head.

The next morning I awoke from a deep sleep with a lot of 'sand' in my eyes.
I concluded that I was visited by the Sandman &ndash; who else could it be?
This was a very real experience and I remember it today as something that
actually happened.

This and many experiences since have caused me to question my everyday reality
as being unquestionably true. There's something fishy going on around
here&hellip;

A common experience I suspect many people have is, what I call the **Mirror
Delusion.**  For many years, as I was growing up and well into young adulthood,
I felt the image looking back at me from the mirror *was* me - it looked like
me, it made funny faces, mimicking the ones I was making, it was sad when I was
sad and sick when I was sick - it was me.

But then there was a time when the body started to lose its youthful luster and
I started to recognize something in the mirror that was not me! It tried hard
to convince me by its mimicry - a skill honed over many years, but I didn't
fall for it. I didn't fall for it because, even though it looked like me and
acted like me &ndash; **it didn't feel like me.** 

It was obviously getting older and I was not! I didn't feel any older, as
a matter of fact, I didn't feel old at all. The body had a few ache's and pains
but, inside, I didn't feel older &ndash; I just felt like I've always felt. 

I realized that my internal perception of myself was not tied to age at all
- it seemed to be ageless even though my body was showing the typical effects
of aging, graying hair, wrinkles, even, some would say, a protruding belly.

Something strange is going on here!

I read the book *Autobiography of a Yogi* when a senior in high school,
actually &ndash; I consumed it. It revealed a world I couldn't imagine &ndash;
*as real*, of people, doing extraordinary things and living life in a way far
different than I had learned. I was intrigued and fascinated &ndash; they
weren't even on drugs!

Can people really do that? Can life be lived and experience had that deviate
so drastically from the 'grow up, get an education, have a career, raise
a family, happily retire' model of life I had been taught?

It was a question that led me further into an answer. I took several stops
along the way, one was Carlos Castenada, a mystic in different clothing &ndash;
and Gandhi, who taught the world of peace and the power of conviction to the
truth of love, and Martin Luther King, Jr who demonstrated that same truth in
the US.

Internally I was drawn to discovering extraordinary experience &ndash; apart
from the norm, and outwardly the power of truth and conviction &ndash; was
being demonstrated to me.

There *is* something strange going on here.

<div class="bg1">
Take a moment &ndash; right now, and remember the extraordinary experiences
that you have had. We all have them in one way or another. Maybe you were
thinking of someone and out of the blue they called. Or you suddenly felt
a deep connection and love for everyone you met. You might have felt an
extraordinary sense of peace and well-being descend upon you &ndash; one never
before experienced. Or a profound connection with a stranger you met.

Experiences like these, and many many others, are messengers bidding you to
explore more deeply. There is a world of experience &ndash; out there &ndash;
that is asking for your attention and awaiting your discovery.

An extraordinary experience is a taste of a consciousness, a way of being, that
is not of this world but available within it. It is extraordinary precisely
*because* it is not ordinary &ndash; and not ordinarily experienced in everyday
life.

Don't you want to discover more?

Join me as I begin to share my journey of discovery of
Christ Mind. I'll write of how I found myself where I am, what Christ Mind
means to me and where I find inspiration. Then I'll begin the exploration of
Christ Mind and the journey of embodying Christ &ndash; right here, right now,
right where I find myself.

This is a process of self-discovery that I want to share so that it moves more
deeply into my being &ndash; beyond my conscious experience.

So join me here and offer your comments; I would love to have a real
conversation begin.

See you soon,

R ;-)
