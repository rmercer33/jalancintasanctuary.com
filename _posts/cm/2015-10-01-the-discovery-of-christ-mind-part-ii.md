I grew up in a small farming community in southern Minnesota. It was very safe
with wide open spaces to explore and small enough where I knew a majority of
the people in town. But, I didn't want to stay there &ndash; feeling overly protected
from the world and feeling that I didn't know anything about it. I remember
thinking the people in New York City were very different from me and the people
in Los Angles too.

The summer after graduation from high school I hit the road with Tom
and we hitchhiked to Denver intending to visit a friend who used to live in our
little town. This was my first adventure traveling so far from home &ndash; with
a destination in mind but no idea how we were going to get there. It was an act
of faith, but not seen that way, taken by the innocence of youth with the
desire for adventure and discovery.

We arrived totally unannounced with no one expecting us. The girl we traveled
to visit had left earlier that day for a two-week vacation and, with our
arrival, her mother scrambled to find someone who would show us around. To our
great delight, we met two beautiful girls and were treated to a grand tour of
the Denver area.

This experience brought me back to Colorado many times and the American West
became a beacon for adventure and discovery. The West called me and was always
the answer to a yearning that I did not understand but felt whenever my life
became mundane or an opportunity to travel arose. 

Travel was one of the ways in which I found extraordinary experience. I had
very little money, but that did not stop me. At one point, I remember selling
my cherished record collection to get the money I needed. And I wanted to
travel without spending money or as little as possible. Not because I didn't
have any, but more as a challenge to see how little money I actually
needed to to go where I wanted to go.

Before one trip, I rigged up a minimalist solution devoid of tent and backpack
that included a lean-to that doubled as a swag in which I rolled up all my stuff
and wore it over my back. Those were days of discovery made possible by
a desire for adventure and a complete lack of time constraints.

During one of those early trips to Colorado with my buddy Tom, I found myself
sitting on a cliff in the foothills of Pikes Peak near Green Mountain Falls,
legs dangling over the side and facing east toward the flats of eastern
Colorado. It was a beautiful sunny day and we were just basking in the sun
enjoying the fresh mountain air.

I marveled at the magnificence of the mountains &ndash; even of the foothills
that were much smaller than then the many Colorado peaks exceeding 14,000 feet.
So majestic, pristine, and beautiful they *crackled* with the exuberance of
life. I wondered if the mind of man could build even a single mound that could
rival the lowliest of foothills.

Basking peacefully in the cool afternoon sun my mind began to imagine how
a foothill might be constructed right there &ndash; next to the one I was
sitting on. I imagined a huge quarry just over the horizon, in the prairie of
eastern Colorado, and a long line of dump trucks inching slowly toward the
loader filling each with a load of dirt and rock.

Then proceeding slowly west up to a flat spot near my vantage point, each truck, coming one by
one, dropped it's load and headed back for another. Each one packing the load
of the one before and slowly making a road ascending the growing pile of dirt
and rock. The mound was growing and the steady stream of trucks, bumper to
bumper, extending from beyond the horizon, was focused and purposeful, moving
unbroken about the task.

I was consumed by the image and could actually *see* it and watch the mound
rising in front of me.

Suddenly, an overwhelming blast of energy entered my body through my chest and
engulfed my entire being &ndash; it took me from awareness of time and space
and body to an experience of pure, radiant, all-encompassing, overpowering
love! A feeling so profound that elicited a flood of tears coming from a depth
never imagined.

I was loved totally, I was accepted completely, I was held securely and rested
in a peace so deep where tears of gratitude purely flowed.

Slowly the intensity began to recede and I became aware of myself. I tried to
re-engage the feeling by forcing tears but to no avail. I didn't want it to
stop, but it departed with the same degree of mystery from which it came. 

There is more to share but I'll leave that for another time.

I don't remember what happened after that, but it *changed me*. I received
a taste of life that far exceeded anything known in the world of my experience
and showed me something truly incredible &ndash; mind-blowing &ndash; exists
and can be experienced.

Something fishy *is* going on and I want to know what it is!
