Who or what is God? This is an age old question and one that certainly challenged
me for some time.

I was sharing with Rick about writing this post and asked him about a great
definition he had shared recently.

“Kate, Raj (through Paul Tuttle) shares that the movement of God is what is
being everything forever – continuously.”

Rick continues, “God is not a noun, as in a person, place, or thing. No, no, no
- God is a verb, the present flow of life - just as it is. This means that God
is showing up right now - in everything, you and me, the trees, on and on. All
of Creation literally is God showing up right NOW!”

I smile to myself feeling Rick’s excitement and add, “Yes, the mysterious flow
of all life, the life force in everything.” I pause momentarily, and then add,
“When I was growing up I used to believe it was some old grey haired man
sitting on a cloud in the sky.”

“Yes and this was a judgmental God, one you can’t trust, he could turn on you
in the blink of an eye if you didn’t behave properly. As long as you did the
right thing all is good but watch out if you screwed up,” Rick replies.

As I muse for a moment I recall that Almaas in his book Facets of Unity refers
to there being a constant unfoldment in the cosmos according to its own laws,
an unseen universal plan where there is an evolution that has its own momentum
and its own direction and that we are an aspect of this.

“It is so amazing to really consider God as an incredible constant, mysterious
flow of all life, a mystery moving and weaving all things in the cosmos,”
I share and then look around me&hellip; the rice paddies, the birds, the
breeze, the sunshine, the trees, even me! 

I wonder what other ideas you have had about who, what God is and how this has
changed for you? Would love to hear from you?
