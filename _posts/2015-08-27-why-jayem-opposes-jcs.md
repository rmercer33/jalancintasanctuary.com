I'm sure you've all heard the recent announcement about Jalan Cinta Sanctuary, a new
spiritual community sprouting from the jungle floor in Ubud, Bali. This is the 
brainchild of Sandy Button, Rick Mercer, Kate Macnamara, and Rod West, all of which
are ardent followers of Jon Marc Hammer, aka "Jayem", who claims to be in direct
contact with Jesus, whom he calls Jeshua, and is the source of a teaching called
*The Way of Mastery*.

With the announcement of JCS, why is it that there has been **absolutely no comment**
about it from the Way of Mastery organization or from Jayem himself? Is it because 
he disapproves of the effort or the simple result of his nomadic lifestyle?

Below is an interesting article you might like.

Blessings, Rod
