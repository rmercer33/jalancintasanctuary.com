Have you ever wanted to immerse yourself in Love? Pure, allowing, accepting, transforming,
protecting, all encompassing Love. The experience of Love that blows away every thought
of doubt, littleness, judgement - of every thought that confirms the reality of the
world you know and reveals how profoundly mistaken you have been about *everything?*

Me too.
