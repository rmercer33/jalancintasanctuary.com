The importance of providing a *truely safe* environment for healing cannot be overly
emphasized. Where trauma had resulted in severe conditions of psychological illness
the need for safety is paramount. **It is not possible** for those individuals to 
begin to consider the hope of change without an unquestionably safe environment.

We *will* provide such an environment at Jalan Cinta Sanctuary and encourage all to
come for respite and healing. Because of this it is a major focus of the sanctuary to
provide the necessary teacher training so that even the most critically ill people
can find the qualified help they need.
