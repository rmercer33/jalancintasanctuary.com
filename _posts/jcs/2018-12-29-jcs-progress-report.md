# December 2018 Update

All preliminary steps for construction of Jalan Cinta Sanctuary have
been completed – yay! Now we are poised to begin villa construction as
our next phase. Will you join with us?

Take a look through our <a target="_blank" href="/mobile/">flipbook</a>,
offering a short summary of Jalan Cinta Sanctuary and contact us to find out more.

Below is a summary of items to date:

* All building permits obtained

    It is always an interesting process watching the legal team go through
    design and development hoops, reviews and redrafts. Until finally, the
    all clear is given and our building permit (what they call an IMB in
    Indonesia) is obtained.

* Clearing the way

    As the Sanctuary is located quite a fair way off the road with a 3-meter
    wide driveway, one of the first things that had to happen was making way
    for the driveway. Which meant our beautiful local families had to
    demolish their ancient kitchen, relocating and constructing anew on a
    different section of their land. This allowed our access way to be
    cleared.

* Time for a ceremony

    In typical Bali fashion, before any building can begin we ask permission
    from the gods. Representatives from the local village, our local family
    and the manggku (priest) joined with us one afternoon to bless the land
    and project.

* Building a bridge

    It still makes me laugh even today that our first step true step in
    building was the development of a small bridge over the local waterway
    that supplies water to the rice farmers in the area. As we like to say,
    the first thing we had to do was “build a bridge and get over it”.

* Limestone Driveway Base

    Next step was placement of our limestone base for the driveway. Or, as a
    friend shared, what looks like an, ‘oatmeal’ driveway into the
    Sanctuary.

* Fencing

    Fencing the boundary was next. While we have a traditional ‘walled’
    fence on the villa section, to ensure privacy. The rest of the property
    has wire panel fencing, which will allow lots of passion fruit to be
    grown on it, therefore creating a much more natural look and feel.

* Clearing and Digging a well

    Next we cleared the block and dug our deep water well, (called a ‘sumor boar’ in Bali).

* First Building Constructed

    For the first building we constructed the ‘technicians’ rooms, which
    include: water tank, electrical panelling, storage room, maintenance
    room and security room. This L shaped building is located on the boarder
    of the property.

    We elected to put a second story on this building, which will house 2 x
    backpacker style accommodation options. These rooms will allow us to
    cater for all budgets for accommodation.
