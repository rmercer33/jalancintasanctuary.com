Now that the JCS blog is launched you might be interested in learning how to use the features
it supports. There are not many posts to sift through yet but, when there are, you'll be able
to search by author, category, and tag.

<span id="tour-stop-h">We hope you'll join the conversation</span> by using the
discussion and collaboration tools built into the blog. You can comment on
posts using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/about), which describes itself as the
*Web's Community of Communities*, and discover the expressive power of web
annotation using [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is).

## Take the Tour

We've put together a short on-line tutorial to introduce you to these features. It's available 
when viewing any blog post. Just look for the <i class="rounded-2x icon-custom icon-color-u fa fa-magic">
</i> button on the right side of the page. Do you see it? Go ahead, click it to take the tour.

The blog supports two ways for you to get involved. 

1.  Disqus
2.  Hypothes.is

## [Disqus](https://disqus.com "Disqus")

Disqus is a discussion and comment tool that is embedded into the blog and generally available on 
each post. To make a comment you need to log in using your existing Twitter, Facebook, or Google 
account or create a Disqus account and login with that.

Login to Disqus by clicking the Login button at the upper right of the comment form - right there
at the red arrow on the top. You can create an account here if you don't already have one. 

Notice the red arrow at the bottom left? It's pointing to the **Subscribe** link where
you can request email notification of new comments on a post. We hope you'll sign up and join
in by commenting on the posts you find interesting.

## [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is "Hypothes.is")

Hypothes.is is a document annotation system for the web. It's a great way to underline and notate
the parts of a post that you want to remember. Notes and highlights presist and will be
available whenever you return to the post.

The highlights you make are private and will be seen only by you. Notes are public by default and
can be seen by anyone with a Hypothes.is account. You do have the option of making notes private
in which case they can only be seen by you.

Highlights and notes are associated with text in the post. To initiate an annotation simply 
use your mouse to highlight the appropriate text. Doing this will cause this
![](/public/img/blog/rick/img/hypothesis-note.png) dialog to display from which you choose
if your annotation is a note &ndash; the icon on the left or a highlight &ndash; the icon
on the right.

You are required to create an account and login before creating annotations.
This is so the highlights and notes you make can be properly displayed and
attributed to you. You can see the notes made by everyone and have the ability
to reply to another persons annotation. All annotations on a page can be shared
to social media sites and email. 

Hypothes.is makes it easy to target comments directly to selected text. We encourage you to 
try it out, play around and see how useful annotations can be.
