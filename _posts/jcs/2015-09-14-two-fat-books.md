Sandy called and said, "Are you busy? Come on over." She didn't say any more
than that, but I did feel something was happening that she wanted me to be part
of. So, I pulled away from what I was doing and begin the 2-minute walk to her
house.

Approaching the gate I could tell the architect was present along with several
others and there was a feeling of excitement as I entered. He had been very
busy the last few weeks preparing two thick books of drawings detailing every
bit of what will emerge as the Jalan Cinta Sanctuary.

The books were impressive and especially the drawings of the villas and the
pods. These have been the focus of the design effort for the last several weeks
and now they are complete. He even had 3d drawings that looked exactly like
photographs taken from several points within the villa - as though it was
a done deal and already built.

I left with a feeling of excitement and an image of JCS slowly appearing where
once only jungle could be found.
