Well, here we are and I've been asked to share my vision with all of you. This is an
easy task indeed and one that I've been developing throughout my life. It's been
shifting and changing and I have grown and learned about myself and the world.

One thing I can tell you right off the bat is - nothing that I write here has any
truth to it, not one bit. I'm making it all up and doing it in such a way that I 
totally believe it. It *is* true to me! But, I also know that I may not feel that
way tomorrow. 

Seems my truth is changeable and what can be changed cannot be True because what is
True today must be True tomorrow and for every tomorrow that follows or it is not True.
The Truth can never be not true - if it is it is *not* true by definition.

The Truth *is* true always.

Chew on that one for awhile.

Rod
