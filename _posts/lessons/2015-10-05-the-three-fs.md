Even though in our spiritual journeys we come to know that who we are is not
limited to the body and the mind, we have indeed chosen to have a human
experience in physical form. In our human form, there is an incredible security
system to keep this body-mind safe. This security system is often known as the
‘stress’ or ‘trauma’ response and incorporates three different ways of
responding to a threat.  The three responses are the *fight, flight and freeze*
response.

To put it simply, in nature when there is a threat the lion has strength so he
uses the *fight* response while the horse has speed so he uses the *flight*
response and flees. The deer who often cannot outrun or fight off the threat
uses the *freeze* response. Sometimes either the *fight* or *flight* response may be
used before the *freeze* response. In other words, the deer may first try to
outrun the predator than when this is failing the *freeze* response is triggered
in a desperate attempt to survive.

In everyday life we can encounter experiences that may trigger a level of these
responses. Which way would you respond in this example?

The tricky thing is that **the security system can be triggered by real or
perceived threat**. In other words, if we think fearful thoughts we can trigger
this response even when there is no real threat. So learning how to heal
fearful thinking at a causative level is important.

When the *fight* or *flight* response is triggered the body sends blood to the
large muscles in the legs and arms, away from the gut, so action can be taken
quickly. This is why stressed people often have digestion or gut problems.

When there is a real threat and action is required during the *fight* and *flight*
responses, chemicals released in the body to enable it to take action quickly
are burnt off. However, when the threat is only a perceived threat, they
aren’t and this can be problematic such as restlessness and insomnia.
Individuals who struggle with chronic fatigue or illnesses such as
fibromyalgia may have overused the *fight* or *flight* responses and have
exhausted their systems.

The *freeze* response is a little different from the *fight* and *flight* responses.
In the freeze response the nervous system shuts breathing down to a minimum as
chemicals are released to paralyse the body to some degree. In a frozen state
the prey may fool the predator as they appear dead and predators usually hunt
live prey. It's like the startled deer in headlights, they just freeze and don’t
move.

Children who are being sexually abused often resort to the freeze response.
Children have neither the strength to fight or the speed or even opportunity to
flee so they shut down in an attempt of not being noticed by the predator in
order to protect themselves. 

From my own learning, I have found it is not only an event, situation or
an encounter that can trigger the *freeze* response after experiencing trauma in
childhood, it seems just an awareness of certain energies at play in
interactions e.g. manipulation and dishonesty can subconsciously trigger the
*freeze* response if they are linked to the initial trauma. 

In nature, animals do what is known as the ‘shake off’ where they have a type of
seizure and the trauma response is released and e.g. the deer goes off to eat
grass. In our human experience we can struggle to release this response easily
and it can plague individuals when there is any hint of threat that links to
the initial trauma.

In my post about [*loving our humanity*](/lessons/2015/09/15/loving-my-humanity.html "loving our humanity") 
I divulged my own struggle with the
*freeze* response being triggered and how this has lead me being more inclusive
of compassion for myself  in my own journey and for clients. A sense of safety
is paramount for any healing to occur and compassion builds this sense of
safety. If we do not feel safe, the trauma response can be triggered and then
this will need to be supported so it releases before any further attempts to
heal the original trauma can be begin.

In healing past trauma we need to heal from the event of the trauma, we need to
heal the beliefs we form about ourselves and the world from the trauma and then
the nervous system also needs loving support to heal. In our humanity many of
us who have experienced trauma may have the ongoing effects of these responses
triggered in varying degrees under certain conditions and it is important to
not judge ourselves if this occurs, it is just a natural response in the human
body-mind. 

In our evolution the limbic system, the inner brain formed, which is where
safety and survival is controlled. Later in our growth the outer cortex of
the brain developed and this is where many finer skills are governed including
communication. For any of us who have experienced the *trauma* response it is
very difficult to communicate in a way that alerts another that we may need
support.

For the nervous system, healing may indeed include fostering the conscious
awareness of the *trauma* response if triggered, mindfulness, caring and
compassion for oneself to create a safe field for the response to release. 

> In a safe and compassionate field the **freeze** response is able to melt.

I wonder that meeting ourselves or another in our humanity, our human
experience in the ’here and now’, even in the trauma response, is the doorway to
healing. Then, when ready, we can begin to open to the possibility of a deeper,
higher perspective of what may really be going on under the surface of our
experiences and suffering.

There may appear to be a paradox here, because who we really are, our inner
essence, our True Self is already perfect and whole and can never be harmed.
Yet there is a journey through the doorway of our humanity and our experiences
to come to know this reality. 

I will share again shortly in another post more about our True Self and other
such topics. Would love to hear from you, or if you have any questions.
