It seems the universe is constantly giving me clear guidance and direction,
yet sometimes a little support to understand that guidance and direction makes
a huge difference.

To share a little about what has just unfolded, if I may, as it has left me
smiling so much.

I hadn't been smiling with my computer as for some reason my Outlook email was
telling me there was something wrong with a file and it couldn't open. Now this
weekend I had wanted to do some work with my next book that involved stored
emails, so I was feeling a grrrr moment and the computer guy who usually helps
me wasn't available until Monday, grrrr, an opportunity for breathing. I had
been to the "help" section of Outlook and it gave me really clear
guidelines to go to drive:/Program... That sounds great but where the **!@#$%^&** do
I find the "drive thingo?"

Today we were all sharing on Skype about the language we use on our website to
convey what Jalan Cinta Sactuary is all about so others can understand and
feel the energy. Later on I shared with Rick that I was having a problem with
my emails, and he offered some tech support (being a cool techy sort of guy is
how he describes himself).

So there he is in Bali and I'm here in Aus and
I share my screen with him via Skype. He begins to give me guidance, "go to
... and let's see, maybe click on ..." I fumble and click a bit too fast
at one point and he says, "Kate, slow down, let's just read this bit so we
understand it" and then he guides me with the next bit. Now in a very short
time it seems obvious where the "drive thingo" is, it's under My Computer...
a few of those old thoughts pass through my mind, the ones that would leave me
feeling like an idiot. I choose to just witness them and let them pass on by.

I feel no judgment from Rick, he remains cool and patient (he really is a cool
techy sort of guy) and this supports me to just stay present with the task at
hand and after a few more clicks we find the "repair thingo" and it works!

Interesting being on Skype share screen, he couldn't do it for me (that's what
the other computer guy would have done for me through "team viewer"), this time
Rick just supports me and I do all the clicking. It actually felt
empowering and I learned through the process.

It occurs to me that sometimes things become easier when there is support with
the steps in our journey. Rick knows what is under the hood in a computer so
the instructions to go to "drive..." is easy, but it wasn't quite enough for
this student, there was a step missing i.e. go to "my computer and click
on..."

Since then I have reflected with this and there is much in it.

I recall the first time I heard the reference to the word Christ used in
spirituality and awakening. I had only known of it from boarding days school
before this. I didn't know what it really meant. In studying counselling and
psychology I learnt that inside of every one of us is True Self. Though in
modern psychology this has been referred to as True Self, Authentic Self,
Transcendental Self, Real Self, Soul, etc.

Firstly, I needed to learn and experience that there is a part of my own being
that can witness my mind thinking thoughts. Who is this witness
I wondered? Another way I used to reflect was there was a part of me that
actually knew if something was truly true, like a part of me knew deeply that
I love my children, which part of me is this I wondered? I came to know that
this is the real me, the True Self, she is always there if I choose to stop,
breathe and listen to her, she supports and guides me. The more I have allowed
this the stronger it has become. Now there is a deep knowingness that this is
my True Self, Soul and this essence of my being is what is also known as
Christ.

Along the way have known some incredible teachings and teachers that have
supported me to look "under the hood" in my own being. They spoke in language
that supported me with the stepping stones that I desired to follow.
I remember a mentor of mine, Jayem, sharing with me to "meet the student where
they are at" and I discovered very quickly that I am the number one student to
meet myself wherever I am at. From there it is easier to follow the stepping
stones. Rick met me where I was at in my computer skills and supported me with
the stepping stones, thank you Rick. If he had spoken in "techy" terms only
a select few would understand what he meant and I wouldn't have.

Feeling reflective with the importance of sharing in language that meets myself
and others where ever we are at in our journeys. In counselling it is so easy
to begin to use certain terms. I have learnt what they mean, I have studied and
looked under the hood of the human mind (much to learn though), yet if I do not
share in language that others, who may not have looked under this certain hood,
can understand, so much is lost in the sharing. It is not truly supportive.
There becomes a gap, similar to what I experienced with the guidelines given
from the "help" section in Outlook. Rick used terms I could understand, not
because I am less than or anything like that, he just simply met me where I am
at in my understating of computers and from there supported me to journey to
where I desired to go.

Thank you to all the wonderful teachers and teachings, friends and family that
have supported me with the stepping stones of this incredible journey, this
amazing adventure of life. An adventure that has lead me to be a part of
Jalan Cinta Sanctuary and the unfolding stepping stones of learning about
the Way of Love.
