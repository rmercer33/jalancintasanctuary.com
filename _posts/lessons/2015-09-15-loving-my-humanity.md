The last three months have been a challenging yet incredible time. To put it
succinctly, it has been a time of embracing everything with Love in a much
deeper way. The *Way of Love* has been teaching me what this ‘way’ actually is
&ndash; for it is a way unknown in the smallness and limitations of my mind.

<span id="tour-stop-h">During</span> these last three months since the
pilgrimage to Israel and France I have welcomed a familiar dreaded response in
me where I feel myself begin to implode, I become numb yet devastated. If
I attempt to share I witness that my ability to communicate becomes poor as the
outer cerebral cortex shuts down and the limbic system kicks in. I feel alone,
isolated and shut down.  I have felt distressed that this response still occurs
even though these days to a lessening degree. 

I have learnt to breathe and inquire deeply into my mind to heal the taproots
of fear based beliefs in psychological training and in the Way of Mastery and
so much has shifted and changed within this life because of this. Healing has
continued for the childhood trauma, the beliefs formed from the trauma, the
depression, the post-traumatic stress disorder and now more so, the crippling
effects of the neurobiological response that is actually there only doing its
job to protect me as a body-mind. I learnt long ago as a little girl to
‘freeze’ in an attempt to keep me safe from harm and the vile feelings of
unwanted sexual touch.

I have learned that I had been sub consciously judging myself for how I am in
relation to the continued effects of the neurobiological ‘freeze’ response
triggered under certain circumstances, such as feeling unsafe especially if
there has been what may be perceived as ‘secret attack’, linking back to the
abuse from father. We know in deeper spiritual wisdom we as soul are ultimately
safe and as soul nothing can harm us, yet in our human experience we can feel
harm and its effects and we cause harm also.

My inner guidance over the last three months was to simply stay at the edge of
my mat with this, to not even ‘try’ to heal it. To not ‘wrong make’ of myself,
to not judge, blame to project upon myself, attempt to fix, etc. To not
even tell myself things such as ‘this is fused to a belief that I am a body.’
This may be true, but unhelpful in the moment. To be with all that arises, to
embrace it, to allow the depression triggered on the pilgrimage to be there,
the trauma response triggered on the last evening, to be present,
witness, breathe, to meet myself as the student right where I am.

After the pilgrimage I felt overwhelmed and resigned as a teacher with the WOM
as felt unsupported in that role and unable to keep up with supporting students
in the Jewels course with how I was feeling within myself. 

In these three months I have journeyed in life’s grace, breathing, welcoming
all, taking a deeper sense of responsibility for I have desired this human
experience, nothing is happening to me but for me as we have learned. As
I have lived my own journey I have also experienced a shared journey with
Sandy, Rick and Rod and what a ride it has been thus far in answering a call
to co-create *Jalan Cinta Sanctuary* with God. 

<img class="pull-left blog-img-left margin-bottom-20 img-responsive rounded"
   width="40%" src="/public/img/blog/kate/img/WOL-ridge.jpg" />

What a privilege and gift to share with them, to witness their courage,
commitment and devotion to their own remembrance of Truth and of Love and to
be of service to humanity. We have been stepping on the stepping stones placed
before us while learning to really communicate
with each other, share inspirations, feel into the guidance of each aspect of
the incredible manifestation of this Sanctuary. Jalan Cinta means the ‘way of
Love’ in Indonesian. It is as though ‘the way of Love’ has been having its way
with me.

During this significant healing time for me Sandy, Rick and Rod have not been
fooled by my core separation strategies such as withdrawal, not fooled by some
kicking and screaming, not fooled even when it all was aided and abetted by
a ‘freeze’ response. More importantly and by the grace of cosmos, I have been able
to stay with this huge mother of a wave and not get off until to gently coming
ashore in the arms of peace. I have experienced being held in a field of love with them
and many unseen beloved friends and in this felt myself melt.

Through sharing this journey with Sandy, Rick and Rod as we have allowed grace to
weave us, move us, inspire us step at a time, co-creating with God and what
I have shared above about my own journey of staying at the edge of the mat of
what was occurring for me has brought me to an incredible realisation that Love
is to simply Love my own humanity, right here, right now, just as I am. There
is nowhere I need be within my being before I am able to recognise that I am
perfect and whole. My healing and awakening continue, yet it has grokked in so
deeply that;

<div class="bcenter">

> *Compassion for myself brings **heaven to earth** right here, right now, felt
> palpably in physicality. Compassion for myself leads immediately to feeling
> compassion for all beings, our journeys, our experiences of suffering, our
> humanity. By loving my own humanity, I am free to love all of humanity.
> Compassion is exploding my heart open into the Reality of Love again and
> again.*

</div>

Loving my own humanity, compassion for myself, the little girl who ‘froze’, the
adult woman who has struggled and suffered, has opened such an incredible
doorway of feeling, living, embodying compassion and Love in this world, not as
a spiritual concept but as *lived reality*. The motto for Jalan Cinta Sanctuary
is ‘*loving our humanity, living our divinity*’. This came to us and then it
seems to have plunged us into living what this actually means.

We may have learnt the spiritual concepts such as we are ultimately safe or we
are ultimately perfect and whole etc and we can spruce about it, yet for me it
is an ongoing journey, to come to know it as truth, as lived experience. There
is an inspiration to live this experience of Love, bringing spiritual concept into
lived experience and I feel this growing within me and my experiences.
I keep feeling Mother Teresa of Calcutta, her compassion and Love for humanity,
her devotion to God and to service. 

<img class="pull-right blog-img-right rounded-2x img-responsive" 
  width="50%" src="/public/img/blog/kate/img/MotherTeresa.jpg" />

I feel called into service more deeply, with every being that steps through
the counselling practice doorway and to co-create with the universe this manifestation
of Jalan Cinta Sanctuary, a place where the reality of Love is the lived
experience, a place where spiritual concept becomes lived reality and in this
all beings may feel safe to open and heal. The passion and calling I feel in
my heart are expressed in 
[my passion statement](/profile/kate/index.html?id=passion) on the JCS website.

God is opening these arms wide and these arms are given to God to welcome all
through compassion. I am learning the Way of Love and to simply live as guided
by grace to live each step, to demonstrate this, to be the presence of this in
however this shows up through the grace of God. Loving my own humanity right in
this moment is walking the Way of Love and in Love there is perfect safety.

I feel an appreciation for Jalan Cinta not being a branded WOM centre. It has
allowed me to heal more deeply a fear of getting it wrong, a taproot fear of
failing God, etc. It is teaching me to trust Truth moving in this being, to
trust my True Self whilst taking care and vigilance with the mind because in my
humanity I do not know where I am going or why, I do not know what one single
thing is or is for, yet the Creator of all things does and is placing each stepping stone before
me. Jalan Cinta Sanctuary will be what Creation itself creates it to be. **Deep in my
whole being I feel a knowingness that it is a manifestation of the ancient
pathway known as The Way &ndash; birthing in this world to support humanity to ‘return
home’, within their own being to remember who they really are.** To greet and
welcome all beings, right from the first inklings of a desire to heal, to dive
as deeply as they choose to go. The Way for me feels embracing of all beings,
the men in work boots who walk through this door for counselling, to beings
from all walks of life. We are all equal in the eyes of God, no one is special
or more or less than. Love has infinite capacity and Love wants to Love. 

As we walk this journey it is helpful to have others who may seem to have
walked a little ahead of us as they may see more clearly the pitfalls. We do
not always see from the limitations of our own conscious mind what is hidden in
the subconscious, so way showers are important. I have come to realise that
a Way-shower, or a teacher is simply another who points the direction for us to
discover our own inner Truth, to inspire us to look within when the time is
ripe and we are desiring change, to support with the tools and practices that
release our fears that hide our own Truth from ourselves so we may birth again
and again the lived Reality of our True Self, Love. Embodying deep compassion
for oneself and all beings, celebrating the flowering of another’s soul and how
God expresses through them in a myriad of ways. Love and appreciation for
each and everyone’s courage to walk this humanly walk &ndash; the walk to
remember Love, this feels to be the Way of Love in this being.

I feel the deep love of Jeshua and many other beings from other
realms, the cosmic, the intergalactic, incredible beings, loving and supporting us all.
This is now a time to welcome all of humanity in our humanity, for in our
humanity is our divinity and our divinity calls us to Love!

Jayem has shared about carving a pathway that can actually support all beings
from the first inkling to waken all the way into Christ Mind.

I feel called to be of service more and more deeply founded in profound
compassion in my heart. It seems this call to service includes bringing into
manifestation the stepping stoned pathway of courses and retreats that have the
capacity to meet each and every being wherever they are in their journey and
support them to fully heal and awaken. The practical stepping stones of the
ancient Way. Am I a teacher? I am simply me surrendering in devotion
and service as the universe guides.

For several months, I have felt the call to return to Bali by the 25th of
September, not knowing why, yet choosing to trust as I do not know what one
single thing is or is for.  I answered this call some weeks ago, the call to BE
and where to BE, with friends of the heart, on Sunday the 27th of September, the
day of the full moon following the Spring equinox (and it seems others such as
John Mark Stroud have also heard this call in their own way). A day I feel we
are all called into the shared heart of Oneness.

It is as though in the beginning there was the Word of God and this planted
a seed that birthed a root deep in the soil of Mother Earth and a huge tree
grew. As it grew many branches separated off from each other representing
different religions, sects, special groups all believing that they were the
only ones who got the Word of God right and no one else has. Now the Word says,

<div class="bcenter">
> *Beloveds you are all my branches birthed from the One seed, the Word of God.
> Look beneath your feet and feel your own connection with everyone and
> everything and look to the heavens and see you are but one tree, the tree of
> Life. Open your arms wide and receive all for in doing so you receive more of
> me.*
</div>

In this heart, it is not about specialness, special groups or chosen ones,
every being is equal and equally loved by our Creator. I have desired and chosen
the experience of humanity, and compassion for my own humanity returns me to
the Truth of the Reality of Love in a real and lived experience. Live me Love,
I surrender more and more deeply into you and your Divine Will for there is
only One Will.

With compassion and love,

Kate
