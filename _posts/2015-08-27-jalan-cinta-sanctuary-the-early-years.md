The first thoughts of what turned out to be Jalan Cinta Sanctuary were thought many years ago.
While the *ashram* was in full swing and emerging from the flow of everyday life and the desire
to teach of freedom and peace, responsibility, and greater fulfilment was the main motivation,
the thought of a more expansive and supportive space began to grow within my being.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a littler more space - enough to meet the growing demand. And a bigger 
pool and larger meeting area where all would find physical comfort in the midst of deep
emotional exploration.

And the idea grew from there.
