Hi, I wanted to tell you about all the cool stuff - technology, you know, languages, services,
utilities and what-not that went into the building of the JCS website. It's awesome, I hope
you know, and you *need* to be aware of it.

Ok, so if you're inclined to stop reading at this point I urge you to reconsider. Take a deep
breath and look into my eyes. Don't blink and don't think. Lay aside your independence and
give your attention to me - fully.

This is called *presence*, and presence is what you are required to offer me, as your brother, a
living, breathing, expression of God. Yes, God.

You may go now.

Rick
