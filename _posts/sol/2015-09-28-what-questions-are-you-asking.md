It’s important to observe the questions that arise from within your
consciousness. The questions are revealed to us in many ways: our choices of
partners, friends and careers, our dreams, even our religion. All of these are
effects of how we have come to answer the questions, which have, at one time or
another, arisen from within our consciousness. We cannot escape being lived
into the answers to the questions that call us.

At some point in life every human being will ask questions such as:

“Am I living authentically? Am I adapting myself to what others want from me,
or am I actually living the life that truly brings me joy? Do I feel an inner
peacefulness or is there an inner gnawing and dissatisfaction?”

While the form these questions take can appear different for each of us, the
life we shape through our <span id="tour-stop-h">choices begins to</span>
reveal the answer we selected, even if the moment of that selection is now
hidden in the mist of our past.

By looking closely at the questions we ask daily, we discover where our
allegiance lies; is it in survival or abundance, suffering or happiness,
struggle or peace?

One excellent example of how our questions are the source of the life we
fashion for ourselves is Albert Einstein. He once said, “I want to know how God
thinks.”

“How” is always about *mechanics*. How does a bird sing? How does the wind blow?

Einstein became a great scientist, and science is a field of *mechanical
discovery*. He did not become a great philosopher, theologian, mystic,
or Guru. His life demonstrated the passion (what the Buddha called “Single Mindedness”)
required for anyone to live themselves *into an Answer*.

Donald Trump asked a different kind of question, and has, in large measure,
lived himself into an Answer. So did Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Michelangelo,
Shakespeare – the list goes on and on – each of these beings gave themselves
passionately to living into an answer. Their questions were all unique and
personal to themselves.

That same *power* to live into an Answer is flowing through each of us all the
time, and we are all effortlessly using it perfectly!

In this way, we can see our life as the effect of what questions we have taken
to heart, and how passionately we have involved ourselves with discovering the
answers.

So take a look around you: What is showing up in your life? For this will
reveal to you the questions that you have been living in. 

If somebody is struggling to survive and make ends meet, they may be operating
from a deep belief that “life is a struggle” and so the question they have been
living in is something like: “How do I survive in this world?” The universe
responded to the question providing the opportunity to choose survival over
abundance. 

If somebody is living in a loveless marriage, they may be operating from a deep
belief that “I need to be in a relationship to survive in life” and so the
question they have been living in would be something like: “How can I keep
myself safe in this world?” The universe responded to the question providing
the opportunity to feel save, but within in a loveless marriage.

Now if you decide that you don’t like what is showing up in your life, perhaps
it is time for you to ask a different question and explore what it is that you
**truly value** and what you want to **create**.

What would it be like to passionately pursue the answer to questions such as
these:

*“What is the deep meaning and purpose of Love?” “What would it feel like to
Love unconditionally?” “What gift of creation is waiting – longing – to be
expressed through me?” “What would it be like to meet Life in total acceptance
and peace?”*

Is it not time to turn within and ask the question, “What do I want truly?” 

Are you willing to love yourself enough to become an inner explorer and commit
yourself to finding the question that burns within you - the question, which is
true for **you**? And then, commit yourself to *passionately* allowing the answer to
be lived through you, whatever it takes? 

True joy and true fulfillment rest on your decision.
