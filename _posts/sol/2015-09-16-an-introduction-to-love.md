<span id="tour-stop-h">The</span> keystone of any genuine spirituality is Love – the journey of awakening to
the reality of unconditional love, and along the way exploring and experiencing
Love’s other facets: Peace, Truth, Compassion, Union, Joy, to name a few.

Romantic relationships, friendship, family situations, career, spirituality,
everything is totally transformed when ‘Love’ is put under the microscope, seen
truly – and welcomed. 

Here’s a familiar scenario, played out every day across the world and in
thousands of novels, movies and TV dramas: 

Mary and John meet and in that first moment – love flows! They want nothing
more than to gaze into each other’s eyes and connect deeply. Everything about
the other delights them. Soon enough, though, they come together in
a relationship. In the beginning it’s rosy – ecstatic even. The middle is often
a battleground. The ending is icy. Someone who used to be loved is now hated,
or at the very least held in contempt.

We say things like, “Here honey, let me help you move your precious belongings
in” and by the end of the relationship it has changed into “Take your junk and
get out!”

How is it that something that begins with the impetus of love can turn into
hatred? 

Love, that pure unconditional Love, which showed itself (for at least a split
second) in the first moment of meeting, is squeezed out – and what replaces it
is something vastly different! And yet, what replaces it is what we have been
*taught* to call love by parents, family, friends and our society. So, what about
it is so vastly different? 

The answer to this question could fill an entire book and a great deal more!
For now, though, we can summarize it by saying that what we have known as love
in this world is imbued with conditions and rules. It is generally experienced
as possessiveness, manipulation and control. It becomes tainted by the desire
to get from another that which we *think* is lacking within *us*.

If we are honest with ourselves, without ever exposing it truthfully to the
other person, deep down we think things like, “I will love you as long as you
support me, recognize me, always put me first, are always there for me, are
loyal to me, etcetera, etcetera.” Then the moment the other person doesn’t meet
those conditions we feel hurt, upset, wounded, betrayed or angry. 

Our reactions are often vented through projection and attack. You need only
look to what upsets you about the other to find your own set of conditions that
you have placed on love. What was known as love is lost in a myriad of fearful
reactions. 

In those moments we think that love has been lost and our reactions are an
attempt to regain it. 

Everything is either the extension of Love or a cry for help and healing.[1]

This same contraction of love is played out in all forms of relationship
including those at work, at school, at home, with the government, your favorite
sports team, in the garden and in the kitchen, etc, etc – including your
relationship with *Life itself*. Everything, everywhere.... until we decide to
make a different choice. 

In every moment there is a real Love that simply waits for us to make the
choice for it, to call it to us. It’s here already, always. We just need to
welcome it into our awareness. 

It starts with looking at who we are. Who is this “I” that I call “me”? What’s
going on here – *really?* 

Love is the essence of all that you are. Love is the essence of *all* that the
eyes show you. There is nothing you can look upon whose essence is *not* Love.
There is *nothing* you can experience whose essence is not Love. The only
question, then, is: Are you willing to make the journey from fear to Love?

Let *Love* be your guide, *Love* be your teacher, *Love* be your friend. And that
Love is universal. That Love is eternal. And that Love is within you *now*!

Words have a vibration that can be **felt**. Take a moment and get comfortable and
relaxed. Breathe deeply into the belly and allow the following words that
describe the quality of Love we are talking about, to wash through you. Allow
the words to land &ndash; to truly land &ndash; in your being and notice how you feel when
you receive them.

<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

Know that you are loved, loving, and lovable, and that, in Truth, the only
thing that’s occurring is that an old dream is being released, that a new dream
might replace it &ndash; the dream of worthiness, and of peace, and of wakefulness,
and of union with all of Creation.

In this moment you hold all power under heaven and earth to choose for peace,
to extend only love, to forgive instead of judge, to be open instead of
contracted.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

Love is never possessive. Love is never fearful. Love is simply Love.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

All you need is Love. Love fulfills all things. Love embraces all things. Love
heals all things, and Love transforms all things.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

Only Love heals. It’s not judgment that brings about change... Only Love heals.
Bless it all, just as it has been.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

There is an Intelligence, a Love that knows you better than yourself and is
presenting you, moment to moment, with jewels and gems and lessons and
blessings, that something is weaving the tapestry of your life, and nothing is
happening by accident.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

For I say unto you, what you will discover at the end of this pathway is the
perfect *freedom*, the perfect *power*, the perfect *spaciousness*, the perfect *joy*,
the perfect *peace* of living &ndash; literally &ndash; in the Kingdom of Heaven.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

Only Love is Real. God is but Love. You are God’s Creation. Therefore,
*your Reality is Love*.

Only Love is Real. And anything else is the choice to momentarily believe in
illusion.[1]

<div class="separator-red">
<i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-2x"></i>
</div>

Now ask yourself, quietly and with simple wonder: “What would it be like for me
to live from the place of deep knowing that only Love is Real?”
