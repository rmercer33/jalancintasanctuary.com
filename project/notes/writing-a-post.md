# Writing a Post for JCS

JCS.com is a static website which means that there is no dynamic content - that is
the pages are all assembled in advanced and not on the fly as they would be in
a typical content management system like Wordpress.

Because of this it is not possible for you to compose, preview, and publish your 
post to the JCS blog. Instead you'll need to write the post using your favorite
word processor and then send it to Rick in docx or rtf format.

## How the Blog Works

Each post is classified by category and can be associated with zero or more tags. A
category is a means of identifying the major theme or topic of the post, someting
like 'JCS' if the post is about the sanctuary, or 'LTW' if it's about Learning to Whistle, 
or 'Training', etc. 

A tag identifies the topics mentioned in the post such as 'Byron Katie', 'Forgiveness', and
'construction progress'. Associating categories and tags simplify searching for articles
of interest.

The landing page for the blog displays a listing of recent posts. Each item in the list
includes the post title, author, category, publication date, short excerpt, and an
optional post related image.

A user clicks on the post title to read the entire post.

In addition to the recent post list a user can request a post listing by author, 
category, and tag.

## How to Format a Post

Write and format your post the way you want it to look on the blog. 

### Images

When you include one or more images in your post just make a note of where they 
should be placed in text. Use an obvious notation, something like: 

> [place img1.jpg here]

Also tell me how the image should appear. For instance:

1. full width of article
2. half width right justified
3. half width left justified
4. half width centered.

There is no recommended size but one may evolve over time. For now please provide
images that are at least 800px in the longest dimension. That is, 800px wide for
landscape or 800px high for portrait oriented images.

### Quotes, Headings and Emphasis

Use quotes and headings to divide the article and emphasize sections. Just make it 
clear in the document you provide how it should look. Do the same with italicized and
bold text.

I will attempt to format the post to look the same as your document but I will try
to develop a 'standard' way of presenting different bits over time.

## Images on Post List Pages

The list pages will display an image and excerpt for each post in the list. If you
do not provide an image to include on a list page your profile image will be
used instead.

### Images

All images on a list page should be the same size and dimension. I want to use
images with a 4x3 aspect ratio. That means the width = 1.33 x height and defines
an image with a landscape orientation - it is wider than it is high.

So image adjustments may be needed and I can help you out. Just know that if your image
is landscape oriented there is probably no problem but I may need to crop out
important bits if its in portrait. 

Here's some math. 

If the image is higher than it is wide the height will need to be reduced. You can determine
the maximum height by dividing the image width by 1.33 (h = w/1.33).

Generally, w = 1.33h

So, we'll try that and see how it works. Don't fret over it.

### Excerpts

Post excerpts are generated automatically from the first paragraph or subheading (not the title)
if it precedes the first paragraph. You can include a custom excerpt with your post if you like.

The excerpt will also be used as the description when someone shares the link to your post on
Facebook.

## Other Considerations

### Social Image(s)

When a link to your post is shared on Facebook the article excerpt and image will be included. You
can provide an image specifically for this if you want. When you do make sure it is at least
200 x 200 px in size but it should be larger - 800 x 800px, and it doesn't need to be square but
it should be in a landscape orientation. It looks better IMHO.

More than one image can be used if you want to give an option of images to the people who share your
post.

If you don't supply an image specifically for sharing to Fb then the post list image will be used -
see above for more info. If you don't supply a post list image than your profile image will be
used.

### Facebook Sharing Buttons

You can choose not to provide Facebook 'like' and 'share' buttons when your post is viewed. Note
that this does not prevent your post from being shared - it just can't be shared from JCS.

### Reader Comments

We use a web comment service called *Disqus* for accepting reader comments and allowing for discussions
with the author. All comments are moderated and will not be publicly viewable until explicitly 
approved so you don't have to worry about spammers or those who 'misbehave'. 

Readers can comment on comments and share them to Facebook, Twitter, and via email as well.

You should create an account at [Disqus](http://disqus.com) so a thumbnail image will display
when you make a comment. I know, another account. Do it if you want. I can give you access to
the admin panel if you want to see and respond to comments made to all of your posts in one
place.

Comments can be disabled on any given post if you choose or if we decide.

### Annotation

This one is **very cool** and is the technology I'm going to use for LTW but maybe not the exact
implementation. Annotation allows anybody to highlight parts of a post and make a note or comment. It's
a great way to target comments to specific parts of an article.

The ability to do this is an up and coming feature of the web and is being embraced by news and
educational institutions.

Anybody can read annotations but only users with accounts can make them. People can annotate another
persons annotation and conversations can develop.

I will be monitoring this for inappropriate comments since there is no annotation approval process
and all comments are public. Only the commenter can delete a comment so this is an experiment. It is
possible to disable and remove comments from a post so there is a way to mitigate undesirable
content. I am hopeful that this will be a useful addition to the blog.

*You do have the option to exclude this feature from any given post.*

You can play around with it with the 3 square buttons that appear at the top right of the
screen on the post display page.

## What I Need from You

When you're ready to submit your article, please include the following:

1. The article in docx or rtf format
2. The *title* of the article
3. Any images that are part of the article
3. Suggest a category (we're just getting started so try come up with a good one)
4. Suggest one or more tags (article topics that will be searchable)
5. Include an image to display on the post list page (optional)
6. Include image(s) to use when the post is shared to Fb (optional)
7. Facebook like and share buttons, Disqus comments, and Hypothes.is annotations
  are enabled by default. Let me know if you want any of them excluded from your post.

That's it for now.
