        There are many pathways. The focus of Jalan Cinta’s spirituality is the path of
        embodiment &ndash; “down and in” rather than “up and out” &ndash; the teachings that offer
        an invitation to a transformed life, surrendered in this moment to ife, to
        Love, to the Divine, whatever you may choose to call it. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        To live authentically. To live as Love. What does that mean?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Our friends and visitors draw inspiration from teachers of genuine inner
        transformation in the grounded, everyday world, including Way of Mastery &ndash; as 
        offered through Jayem,
        A Course in Miracles, the work of Byron Katie, Cheri Huber, Eckhart Tolle,
        Paul Tuttle &ndash; and others. This
        is the work of turning the pointed finger back to oneself and taking
        responsibility. Of true forgiveness. Of learning to accept and love the body.
        Of seeing Christ in everyone. Of loving what is arising now. Of seeing the
        innocence and play of creation. Of gratitude for it all!
      </p>

      <p>
        Jalan Cinta will develop a series of signature courses and other activities and
        events, both onsite and online, with inherently practical content. The focus
        will be the everyday reality of living as Love.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that focus is also brought to everything at the Sanctuary: how it is
        operated, how decisions are made, how we each as individuals – residents,
        visitors, staff (and the Sanctuary’s pet rabbit) &ndash; interact with each other.
        The place where “the rubber hits the road” is the place of greatest growth!
        This is what is being created at the Sanctuary: a place where we are each
        other’s teacher as we learn together to live as Love. Gritty. Real. And
        sometimes not pretty as the defences against our humanity and our Oneness are
        let go.
      </p>

      <h2>
        There is only one goal.
      </h2>
      <p>
        To wake up. To wake up from the dream of egoic consciousness into the reality
        of Oneness, so that the Divine can live “where once I thought <em>I</em> lived.” In
        other words, to <em>incarnate</em> the Divine. 
      </p>

      <p>
        God wants you! Life wants you! &ndash; fully, wholly, embracing “what is” as it
        unfolds itself. Will you come and play?
