## Who Am I? {#who .h2-prof .margin-bottom-20}

When next someone asks you "Oh, who are you?", please do not give them a name, do not say,

> *Well, I was born in a certain town, in a certain part of the planet.*

Don’t tell them that you are a Democrat, or a Republican, or a communist, or an
atheist, or a Catholic. 

Tell them the Truth:

> **Who am I?**
>
> *I am the extension of Love in form. I have never been born and
> I will never taste death. I am infinite and eternal. I shine forth as a sunbeam
> to the sun. I am the effect of God’s Love.*
>
> *And, I stand before you to love you.*
