        The decision to invest in Jalan Cinta Sanctuary is a choice that will
        transform your life and significantly contribute to the transformation
        of countless others.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Villas and Studios are gorgeous architect-designed, self-contained
        rooms with either spectacular views or your own private courtyard. And
        as a <a href="/operation.html#leaseholder">“Sanctuary Leaseholder”</a>
        you will enjoy the daily bliss of a living, breathing, conscious
        community dedicated to Love.

      <h2>
        Overview
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>The purchase price includes three components</strong>: the cost
        of your room, the land, and a contribution to the common facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>You have many options for enjoying the benefits of your
        investment</strong>. You might choose to live at the Sanctuary full time
        or part time, using it as home base to travel the world, staying for
        however many months a year that suits you. Or simply consider it as an
        investment for your own financial security and the awakening of
        humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Jalan Cinta PT will manage your Villa for you when you are away from the
        Sanctuary,</strong> – renting it to long-term residents and/or adding it to the
        accommodation letting pool available for workshop participants and other
        visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>We expect a healthy net return of between 5% and 10%,</strong>
        possibly even more as the Sanctuary gains a worldwide reputation. But
        please note: this invitation is not for anyone who is simply looking
        for a way to “make money.” A key factor in joining as a <a
        href="/operation.html#leaseholder">“Sanctuary Leaseholder”</a> will
        be your resonance with the vision of what is being birthed here and a
        desire to join in conscious community.
