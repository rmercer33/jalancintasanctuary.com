        The decision to invest in one of the 20 beautiful Villas at Jalan Cinta
        Sanctuary is a choice that can transform your life and significantly contribute
        to the transformation of countless others. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Villas are gorgeous architect-designed, self-contained apartments with
        either spectacular views or your own private courtyard. And as a “Sanctuary
        Leaseholder” you will enjoy the daily bliss of a living, breathing, conscious
        community dedicated to Love.

      <h2>
        Overview
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>The purchase price includes three components</strong>: the cost of your Villa, the land,
        and a contribution to the common facilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>You have many options for enjoying the benefits of your Villa</strong>. You might choose
        to live at the Sanctuary full time or part time, using it as home base to
        travel the world, staying for however many months a year that suits you. Or
        simply consider it as an investment for your own financial security and the
        awakening of humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Way of Love PMA will manage your Villa for you when you are away from the
        Sanctuary,</strong> – renting it to long-term residents and/or adding it to the
        accommodation letting pool available for workshop participants and other
        visitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>We expect a healthy net return of between 5% and 10%,</strong> possibly even more as the
        Sanctuary gains a worldwide reputation. But please note: this invitation is not
        for anyone who is simply looking for a way to “make money.” A key factor in
        joining as a Sanctuary Leaseholder will be your resonance with the vision of
        what is being birthed here and a desire to join in conscious community.
      </p>

        Purchase price details
      </h2>
      <p>
        <em>Please note: All financial sums are quoted in USD</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard Sanctuary Villa lease purchase price is $120,000
        Deposit $12,000
      </p>
      <div class="standout">
        <p>
          <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>&nbsp;For a limited time we are offering the Villas for $100,000. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>
          To secure this price you will need to pay $50,000 by 1 October 2015.
        </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>
          The reason we are making this offer is because a second payment for the land is
          due on that date.
        </strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>A full furniture package is available for $5000.</strong> The furniture package is
        required if you intend to rent your Villa as part of the letting pool. Details
        of the furniture package are available.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The payment of your deposit</strong> will secure the Villa of your choosing from those
        available. We will discuss with you in detail, one-on-one the relative points
        of the options available, to help you make your choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>From our market research</strong> we believe the Villas are priced well below comparable
        Villas for sale in Bali and therefore should be able to achieve a strong resale
        value.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In Bali most properties are leased</strong> from a Balinese owner because of legal
        restrictions on ownership of land. Way of Love PMA has secured a lease until
        1st Jul 2039, with the option for another 25 years. Your Villa will be leased
        from Way of Love PMA for 24 years initially.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>To cover the cost of the day-to-day operating expenses</strong> there is an annual
        Sanctuary Lease Management Fee of $3,000. This covers all maintenance for the
        first five years, sewerage, electricity, tap water, garbage collection and gas.
        It also entitles you to a Sanctuary pass, which will provide you with entry to
        all the general daily and weekly activities including yoga, breathing,
        chanting, movies and talks.
