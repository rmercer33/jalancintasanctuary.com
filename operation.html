        Our desire is to establish a structure of management that provides
        transparency, is inclusive, ensures longevity and invites universal
        wisdom into the decision making process.

      <h2>Way of Love PMA</h2>
      <p>
        Way of Love PMA is a company formed in Indonesia, which owns and
        operates <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> and all associated programs.
        It will be run by a small group of executives.  Specific limitations
        with Indonesian regulations prevent it from being registered as
        a Not-For-Profit entity, it will effectively operate as such by
        investing all profits in service to the healing, awakening and
        evolution of humanity, through a variety of projects both large and
        small.
      </p>
      <h2>Sanctuary Leaseholders</h2>
      <p>
        “Sanctuary Leaseholders” is the term we are using to describe those who choose
        to join with Way of Love PMA by investing in a long-term lease on one or more
        of the Villas or  Studios built within the Jalan Cinta Sanctuary grounds. This
        will form a major portion of the Sanctuary funding – find out more about 
        <a href="villa.html">becoming a Sanctuary Leaseholder.</a>
      </p>
      <h2>The Council</h2>
      <p>
        A Council of Equals, comprising 9 members, will be responsible for the
        operational decision-making of Way of Love PMA and <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em>. Each
        member brings his or her own experience and direct connection to Source in
        support and service of the Sanctuary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The formal Council will be appointed when the Sanctuary opens. Council members
        will go through a nomination and ratification process. All council positions
        are on a voluntary basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of key importance here is that the Council’s role in decision-making is to come
        into a resonant field: decisions are made from this place. When truth is
        spoken, everyone can feel its essence. 
      </p>
      <h2>Founding Members</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to the implementation of the Council, a group of people has stepped
        forward to support in establishing the Sanctuary: the “Founding Members.” This
        group will dissolve when the formal Council is appointed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Founding Members are:

      <h2>The Sages</h2>
      <p>
        There are those who have journeyed through life and have deep experience with
        different areas of expertise – the Wise Ones, our elders and sages – those who
        can provide support, guidance and share their wisdom. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In recognition of this, our Sages will be appointed by mutual agreement of the
        Council. They will be approached for their advice, wisdom and experience to
        assist in resolution of any issues that may arise.
