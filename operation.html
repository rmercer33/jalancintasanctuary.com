        Our desire is to establish a structure of management that provides
        transparency, is inclusive, ensures longevity and invites universal
        wisdom into the decision making process.

      <h2>Jalan Cinta Bali PT</h2>
      <p>
      <em>Jalan Cinta Bali PT</em> is a company formed in Indonesia, that owns
      and operates <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em>. It will be run by a small group of
      executives. While specific limitations with Indonesian regulations
      prevent it from being registered as a Not-For-Profit entity, it will
      effectively operate as such by investing profits in service to the
      healing, awakening and evolution of humanity, through a variety of
      projects both large and small.

      <h2 id="leaseholder">Sanctuary Leaseholders</h2>
      <p>
        “Sanctuary Leaseholders” is the term we are using to describe those who
        choose to join with <em>Jalan Cinta Bali PT</em> by investing in a
        long-term lease on one or more of the Villas built within
        the <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> grounds. This will form the major
        portion of the Sanctuary funding – find out more about <a
        href="villa.html">becoming a Sanctuary Leaseholder.</a>
      </p>
      <h2>The Council</h2>
      <p>
        A Council of Equals, comprised from Sanctuary Leaseholders, will be
        responsible for the operational decision-making of <em>Jalan Cinta
        Sanctuary</em>. Each member brings his or her own experience in support
        and service of the Sanctuary.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Council will become operational when the Sanctuary opens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of key importance here is that the Council’s role in decision-making is to come
        into a resonant field: decisions are made from this place. When truth is
        spoken, everyone can feel its essence.
      </p>
      <h2>The Sages</h2>
      <p>
        There are those who have journeyed through life and have vast experience with
        different areas of expertise – the Wise Ones, our elders and sages – those who
        can provide support, guidance and share their wisdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recognition of this, we will appoint Sages, by mutual agreement of the
        Council. They will be approached for their advice, wisdom and experience to
        assist in resolution of any issues that may arise.
      </p>
      <h2>Founding Members</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to the implementation of the Council, a group of people have
        stepped forward to support in establishing the Sanctuary: what we are
        calling the “Founding Members.” This group will dissolve when the
        formal Council is activated.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Founding Members are:
