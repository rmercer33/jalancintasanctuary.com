      Jalan Cinta Sanctuary, dedicated to spiritual awakening, personal
      growth, healing, and living love. Dedicated to supporting you!
      </p>

      <p>
      It often feels like there is so much division, hatred and suffering in this
      world. But there is another way. A Way founded in Love.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> is a beautiful and palpably conscious space. A space
      dedicated to <strong>loving our humanity</strong>; accepting and loving who we are including the
      tears, traumas, past experiences, bad moods and unkind thoughts &ndash; all of it. A
      space dedicated to <strong>living our divinity</strong>; acknowledging that within every man,
      woman and child there is a miraculous wellspring of wisdom and the infinite
      extraordinary power of creation.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here seemingly ordinary, everyday people from all around the world come to
      immerse, to heal, to transcend, to share, to learn, to grow, to remember and to
      discover who they really are.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here budding and internationally renowned teachers, authors, practitioners,
      therapists and mystics come to immerse, develop, create and share their
      workshops, events, gatherings and offerings.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here a global community of friends come together to laugh, to cry, to play, to
      explore, to support, to transform and to serve.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here there are no guru’s to worship, compulsory teachings to follow, or
      specific practices that must be engaged. You are free to follow your own path.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here everyone is acknowledged as the divine light they truly are; that essence is
      seen, cultivated and honoured.
      </p>

      <p class="margin-bottom-30">
      The question we ask is simply “What does it mean to live as Love?”
      To live the answer is our quest, challenge and our shared desire.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Here is Your Opportunity
      </h2>
      <p>
      The construction of <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> is underway, with 
      limited opportunities for you to invest in a <a
      href="villa.html">Villa</a> and become an integral part of this
      place; this Sanctuary for Love.
      </p>

      <p>Anytime you are not staying at the Sanctuary, you have the option to
      allow your <a href="villa.html">Villa</a> to be rented to others
      who will stay on-site; therefore supporting them in their own growth. When
      you do you will earn a financial return to support you in pursuit of your
      own life goals.
      </p>
