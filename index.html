        A new sanctuary for spiritual growth, healing, and training is crystalizing out
        of a vision – ground has been broken and the birth is imminent!
      </h2>

      <p>
        The intention is to create a palpably conscious and beautiful space, dedicated
        to loving our humanity and living our divinity. The question we ask is: What
        does it mean to live as Love? – in daily life, where “the rubber hits the
        road.”

      <p>
        We're excited and delighted to share our news with you about <em>Jalan
        Cinta Sanctuary</em> in beautiful Ubud, Bali.  “Jalan Cinta”  means “Way
        of Love” in Indonesian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divine conception has taken place. The sanctuary land has been secured. The
        site plan is emerging.  Inspiration is unfolding. Gestation is
        underway…
