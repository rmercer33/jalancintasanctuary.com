            This section is for you to explore the site plans and artist impressions for
            Jalan Cinta Sanctuary as they come into form over the coming months. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Our initial focus has been on finalising the Villa and Pod designs, along with
            a general sense of the public area buildings – the details are still unfolding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The topography of the Sanctuary land contains a gradual slope that descends to
            the edge of the ravine and then drops off to the river below. Our architect is
            working with the natural flow of the land to maximise the experience of all who
            visit the site. The image below depicts the contour for one section. Visit the
            <a href="gallery1.html">Sanctuary Land gallery</a> for some move images.

            In the overall design we are creating a spacious mix of open-aired and
            air-conditioned rooms, pools, covered walkways, and quiet alcoves. Our
            underlying aim is to create a space of beauty and peace, for quiet ‘inner’
            times as well as times of laughter and song and dance and play! – a palpably
            sacred place where Love and authenticity are invited. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The accommodation is of two types, Villas and Pods, making sure that visiting
            the sanctuary is widely affordable. The gardens will have both edible
            productive areas to grow our own fruit and vegetables and lush landscaped areas
            in the Balinese style. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Great love and care is being given to the details. Some of the features we are
            incorporating in the facilities are:

            There will be many places to sit in quiet meditation and contemplation,
            including some purpose-built meditation decks down near the river, reached by
            steps. On the main sitemap above they are shown as the brown circles. Here is
            an artist’s impression of the decks. A wonderful place to sit and breathe, to

            events, simple accommodations for volunteers, and to offer low
            cost accommodation so that the Sanctuary is widely affordable and available.

            The design and décor has a modern feel – light and airy, simple and elegant,
            splashes of colour introduced with artwork and textiles. The sacred is
            consciously brought into the villa with an altar space, and breathing/yoga
