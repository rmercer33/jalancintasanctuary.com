        Our founding members are all committed to ensuring that <em>Jalan Cinta
        Sanctuary</em> becomes a “living beacon of Love” that attracts,
        welcomes and embraces all who feel the desire to learn, to grow, to
        explore, to experience and ultimately to choose for Love.
      </p>

        We have joined together to serve, and – as they say – it’s going to take
        a village!
      </p>
      <p>
        Later in the project there will be practical ways for you to become involved.
        At this time we have a heartfelt request for you to support the vision in three
        key ways:

        In time we will be putting out a call for some more practical involvement and
        support with other projects that are unfolding. Join our mailing list to
        receive this invitation. And, of course, when the sanctuary opens it will be
        available for you to experience!
      </p>

        Blessings and thank you.
