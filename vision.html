        The physical space
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What will it <em>look</em> like?</strong> 
        A place of simplicity, elegance and beauty, created in
        the Balinese style, emerging from the jungle and nestled among native forest
        trees. A living reflection of Love on Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What will it <em>feel</em> like?</strong> 
        A palpably sacred space of peace, a place of healing
        and quiet joy in nature and companionship… A living emanation of Love on
        Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What will it <em>sound</em> like?</strong> 
        A place of aliveness, with the rushing of the river
        in the ravine below, of sacred chant and secular dance, of song and laughter…
        A living sonic vibration of Love on Earth.

        &hellip; <strong>dedicated</strong> to the surrendered simplicity of Love in action, the daily
        lived reality of Love – chosen consciously as individuals and collectively 
      </p>
      <p>
        &hellip; <strong>supporting</strong> the awakening of humanity to remember our Oneness and the
        truth of who we are: radical ecstatic spirit! 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also intended as a space for creativity and immersion in connection to
        the Divine and to Mother Earth, where who-knows-what projects may be birthed
        for the good of humanity and the glory of That One!
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence: a place where you can come and join with like-minded and
        like-hearted friends: to grow, to play, to participate, to experience, to
        explore, to love, to transform – and to embody the essence of a genuine
        spirituality.
