          <p>
            <strong>When I walked out of my house on a humid Thursday evening</strong>
            fifteen years ago I didn't know that I was embarking on a journey that was to
            change my life profoundly, and forever. Life as I knew it - living in
            Queensland with a high-flying corporate career, awesome house, great car, my
            beloved horses and dog - all about to be surrendered to a passion that set me
            alight like a spark on dry kindling.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I have always had an interest in New Age, Healing, Self-Help and
            Spirituality</strong> although I came from a non-religious background so
            leaned toward words like the Universe and Source.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>So on that Thursday evening,</strong> when my Reiki/Meditation group
            gathered to listen to a recording of teachings channelled through a then
            little-known American, it definitely brought up some judgements. Channelling?
            God? Jesus? Jeshua? Christ? - not for me, thank you! But the moment I heard the
            message I was utterly consumed. I wanted to know more, I wanted to meet the man
            who spoke the words and <em>be part of it</em> - whatever 'it' was. I dived in;
            listened, read, watched and immersed myself in the <em>Way of Mastery</em> and
            all of the wisdom it offered.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Several years later I met the channel, Jayem,</strong> and for the
            first time, the message within the teachings shifted from mental ideas to
            a palpable feeling state within the body. It was then that the spark became
            a flame and life as I knew it was turned upside down.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Shortly afterwards, I felt moved</strong> to leave Australia and
            head for Bali, where I have been learning, and living the teachings as offered
            through Jayem. As his business partner, assistant, boss (as he jokingly calls
            me) and friend it has been a unique opportunity to engage in the work at
            a level that is vastly different to just attending a workshop. I feel enormous
            gratitude that I have been able to play a key role in the set up and
            running of all that has birthed through the <em>Way of Mastery</em> during the
            last eleven years.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="hero text-center">
            <p>
              <strong>Along the way I discovered that my deepest longing and passion lies in
              serving the awakening of humanity.</strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            It has been quite a journey to come to live from a place of true service and
            I also recognise that my journey is just beginning...
          </p>

          <h2>A vision emerged</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>I discovered a profound desire to extend Love,</strong> to touch
            hearts and minds, in the same way I have been touched. And with the gradual
            emergence of a specific vision it focused the energy like a laser beam.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Living in Bali,</strong> I have been immersed in a way of life
            surrounded by the lushness of nature and the ever-present reminder of
            spirituality in the statues and buildings and daily ceremonies of the Balinese
            people.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="hero text-center">
            <p>
              <strong>In that daily soup, deeply engaged with these teachings about Love, there
              emerged within the vision of creating a place of great beauty and inspiration
              - a physical space that is a living, breathing experience of Christ
              Consciousness.</strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <strong>Over time it began to crystallise into physical form</strong> as
            a Sanctuary - a Training and Retreat Centre, a call for a genuinely loving
            community - built in conjunction with the local people, so that their
            traditional ways are honoured and they also benefit from the development. Its
            name, I only discovered quite recently, is <em>Jalan Cinta</em> (the Way of
            Love in Indonesian): Jalan Cinta Sanctuary.
          </p>

          <h2>I see...</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>I see, with huge, overflowing gratitude,</strong> that 'my' entire
            life, with its specific corporate experience and spiritual trajectory, has been
            carefully woven towards this moment, this expression, right here, right now!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I see that I am simply a midwife</strong> in the birthing of the
            Sanctuary. It belongs to no one person, and yet is here to serve anyone who is
            ready for its healing energies. While the Sanctuary is based in Bali, I sense
            that what is developed here, embodying the <em>Way of Love,</em> will extend
            around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I see that each moment, each choice, each decision,</strong> in the
            Sanctuary's creation and on-going running offers an opportunity to surrender my
            own thoughts and be informed by the Divine. To create a vehicle for living as
            Love, for embodying the essence of genuine spirituality, lived daily and lived
            unconditionally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I see that this project is being given to me as an
            opportunity</strong> to hold everyone (and myself!) in Love, to dive more
            deeply into my unique expression of the Divine - of what God desires to birth
            through me - to step into my own awakening, my own Christed Consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>May Love be extended through me,</strong> and as Jalan Cinta Sanctuary
            crystallizes into form, may it offer all who enter the opportunity to awaken to
            their own passion. May I be committed to seeing the miraculous in each being
            who steps through the gates, to reflecting it back to them and supporting the
            birth of their Divine inspirations into the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            May the Divine emerge through each of us for Only Love is Real! Only Love Is!
            And we are One!
          </p>

            <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> and all that will occur here is something truly amazing.
            There is much to prepare, arrange, organise and build!
            Fortunately, a small group of people who all feel in alignment with this vision
            have felt the call to service and stepped forward in support.

          <p>
            Here you can find out a little more about our journeys, and what our passion
            is, as we join together to birth <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em>.

            <p>
              All my life I have asked just one question in many forms. How can we be true to
              ourself and live meaningful, fulfilling, authentic and connected lives without
              limitation? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve argued with myself. I’ve argued with others. I’ve tried to convince myself
              it was beyond reach and wasn’t possible. I’ve felt irreparably broken and
              rotten to the core. 
            </p>
            <p>
              And I’ve felt I was better, smarter and more talented than others.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve found fault with those I declared I loved and chose others for special
              treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve felt alone and lost. Even scared of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a teenager I studied the occult and tarot. At university my thesis started
              to unravel the workings of the ego. I spent a decade in the tribal world of
              politics - a pressure cooker for the ego and then the same in the cut and
              thrust of business. At the time I didn’t realise this time was key to my
              spiritual education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve subliminal highs and the lowest of lows.
            </p>
            <p>
              However even through my darkest moments I could sense there was a way to heal.
              A way to make whole and one again what appeared separate. To unify and reunify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep inside I knew there was a way to live a life that made sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had left school at 15 and retired in my early 40's as a self-made
              millionaire. But it was only when a series of seismic personal events marked
              the unmistakable movement that is the call to awaken.
            </p>
            <p>
              For forty years I was frozen. It took forty years for my soul to thaw, mature
              and be ready to feel again. My soul was safely protected in my ego but now it
              was ready to be birthed into the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I had searched everywhere for what I believed I was missing. But year in and
              year out there was one place I dared not venture.  There was one place I dared
              not look. It was my dark side, my own shadow that terrified me so much that
              held the key. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Little did I know then that in the blackness was my own light.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowly I bought wonder and curiosity to my own consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The victimhood, guilt, blame and judgment of most of my life were replaced by
              awe and amazement. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A deep and profound gratitude for my life began to permeate my being. All of
              it. The bliss and the sadness. The love and the loneliness. The acceptance and
              the anger. This astonishing, amazing, wondrous, incredible, extraordinary and
              inspiring thing called our existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was when I finally started to explore my own consciousness and to thaw my
              frozen heart that true wisdom began to emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now from decades of study and personal exploration the answer to my question
              has emerged with unquestionable clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer was so simple but can take a life time to live.
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer was contained in a word that revealed everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A palpable sensed feeling of connection. A force more powerful and mysterious
              than any other. A way of being that transcends all limitations and problems.
              A pathway home. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Love is all we need. Love connects us to our own soul and our divinity. It
              connects us with our heart and our genius.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love heals our past wounds and transcends judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loves releases our passion and our creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love reminds us we are whole and perfect just as we are. Nothing to change and
              nothing to fix.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love sets us free.
            </p>
            <p>
              AND it was love that brought us all together to build a Sanctuary dedicated to
              our hearts, inspired by our wisdom and made possible by our passion.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Jalan Cinta Sanctuary we come together as a community of equals. True
              friends of the heart. No gurus but many teachers. Each teacher also a student. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We empower each other to access and only ever trust our own direct connection
              with source and to value our own unique genius and gift to the world.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              <strong>It all began with a simple question.</strong> I was a nurse at the time and curious
              about what a visitor had offered a patient. “What’s Reiki?” I asked. She
              beckoned me to her, to simply experience it. Her hands touched my shoulders and
              tingling energy poured through my body. Something stirred deep within my being. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Over the coming years I was thirsty to learn meditation, energetic and
              spiritual healing.</strong> It became a quest to support my younger daughter in her
              struggle with spinal scoliosis and ultimately the radical surgeries that she
              underwent. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Then in the late 1990s, memories of childhood trauma surfaced.</strong> This ignited
              a desperate need to heal the deep emotional and psychological wounds and
              suffering that tormented me. I resourced many avenues of healing, some of which
              gave a sense of relief, yet I knew there must be more.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>A desire began to enter my heart to support others to heal while continuing my
              own journey.</strong> I studied counselling and psychology and set up a private
              practice. Yet even with these skills I still felt there must be more. A deep
              question arose within me: 
            </p>

            <h2>
              How do we truly heal?
            </h2>

            <p>
              <strong>The universe began to answer my heartfelt question,</strong> though I didn’t recognise
              it initially. Through an incredible “coincidence” a magazine advertising a book
              called <em>The Way of the Heart</em> found its way to my kitchen table and fell open at
              the relevant page. I rushed to the phone to order a copy and when it arrived
              I immersed myself in it, a manuscript of profound lessons given by Jeshua, the
              one known by many as Jesus, channelled by a man called Jayem.

              <strong>A new journey began</strong> and the <em>Way of Mastery</em>, as it is 
              now known, led me to
              beautiful Bali for intensive retreats and pilgrimages around the world. It was
              during these retreats that I experienced deep and profound healing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Out of my own deeper healing emerged a desire to share my journey, which
              birthed my book <em>Returning Home to the essence of who I am.</em>  My intention with
              it is to provide a real example and instil hope that we can truly heal – to
              return home to who we are, to Love itself. The desire then evolved into a deep
              passion to support others in their healing journey, to grow into their
              empowerment and awaken to their deepest truth.

            It all began with <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em>, which I read while still in high
            school. That was when the desire to learn the mysteries of the world was first
            sparked within me. It revealed as fact what could only be a fantasy world, and
            awoke within me the potential of living an extraordinary life.
          </p>

          <p>
            I fell in love with the adventures of Carlos Castenada and desired to learn
            about the world through travel. After many years and many challenges
            I eventually found <em>A Course in Miracles</em> and, with that, the flame of desire to
            change my life ignited from deep within me.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started to change, many lessons of love and forgiveness were presented, and
            I felt slow to learn. But more and more the binds of limiting beliefs began to
            loosen and I found my desire for growth continued to increase.
          </p>

          <p>
            I read the <em>Course</em>, did the workbook, and then discovered <em>The Way of Mastery</em>.
            Eventually it took me into the Jewels Course and to Israel with Jayem. And,
            finally, I found my way and moved to the ashram in Bali.
          </p>
          <h2>
            I felt a deep desire to change my life and to actually put the teachings into
            practice. 
          </h2>

          <p>
            Moving to Bali was a huge step in that direction. Everything changed and
            I found myself surrounded by others who had similar desires. I wanted to learn
            and grow, and I wanted to find a way in which to serve – to use my skills to
            extend and express my love for the expression of Christ Mind given by Jeshua
            through Jayem in the <em>Way of Mastery</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time I came to realise that the essence of Christ Mind teachings can be
            found everywhere, and to see it requires only that I be willing to pay
            attention. And I love to ‘discover’ it – out there, in the world, because each
            discovery takes me deeper into feeling what is taught and strengthens my desire
            to learn.
          </p>
          <h2>
            My passion is to dive ever more deeply in the Way of Mastery and other Christ
            Mind teachings and to provide a platform for learning and sharing the
            inspiration that inevitably arises from such a journey. 
          </h2>
          <p>
            Jalan Cinta Sanctuary offers a space rooted in the joint passion of a group of
            friends to consciously grow into Love as a lived reality – and in welcoming
            that as our way of living, to support everyone on the journey of awakening. As
            such I feel it provides an environment that will allow my heart’s desire to be
            fulfilled.
