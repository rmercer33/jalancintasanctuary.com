        There are many teachings, many teachers, many pathways. Few give focus to the
        <em>lived reality</em> of the teachings, the place where “the rubber hits the road.” 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are calling this the Way of Love: not a new message, but the practical and
        focused application of precious teachings of embodiment that already exist. You
        can read more about this <a href="#">on the teachings page.</a>

        Jalan Cinta is devoted to the embodiment of <strong>Love in all our interactions,</strong> day
        to day and moment to moment, including business, organisational, community, and
        interpersonal activities… We are devoted to waking up – to embodying Christ
        – to fully embody the Divine (whatever name you may use to refer to it), here
        and now, in flesh, in the body: “down and in” with all its apparent
        contradictions.

          <em>Only Love is Real</em> is the calling card. Whatever arises in this moment, we are
          dedicated to bringing Love to that, to reveal its gems of growth and insight.

        A radical transformation of humanity is happening. 
      </h2>
      <p>
        All over the Earth people are waking up – consciousness is waking up and
        remembering its Oneness. Another way to say the same is “Love is blossoming in
        form” – and we are each that Love and that form, bodies walking the Earth as
        vehicles of Soul.

          You are the one that comes to bring Light to this world. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are infinite. You are eternal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the beauty. You are the beauty of every ray of Light that dances
          a thousand diamonds across the waters of this planet. You are the beauty and
          the light of every star. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the vastness and the silence and the power of space in which all things
          have arisen in your little physical universe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the brightest of colors and the deepest of tones. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the perfect melody. You are the song, the instrument and its composer,
          and you are the one that delights in the song.

        We are all part of this radical transformation, birthing as the fullness of
        real humanity. Can there be a greater adventure? How deeply are we willing to
        dive?
