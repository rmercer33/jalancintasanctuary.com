        There are many approaches to healing and awakening. Many principles that are
        valuable. There is, however, one principle above all else that has the power to
        transform lives and to transform our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        That principle is simply&hellip; Love.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of us have desired the <em>living</em> experience of Love. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Love heals all things, and it is only with Love that we transcend the old and
        birth the new.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> we are devoted to the embodiment of <strong>Love in all our
        interactions</strong>, day to day and moment to moment, including business,
        organisational, community, and interpersonal activities&hellip;
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only Love is Real</em> is the calling card. Whatever arises in this moment, we are
        dedicated to bringing Love to that, to reveal its growth of gems and insights.
        To be authentic, true, honest and real about what is occurring under our skin.
        And to accept and embrace where we are with love. Knowing that it is only by
        being truly loving to oneself that change can occur. 
      </p>
      <blockquote class="hero text-center">
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
          Love embraces all things, allows all things, trusts all things, transcends all
          things. Love is never possessive. Love is never fearful. Love is simply Love.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
          Love, and give all things complete freedom to be and to do as they will.
        </p>

        Guided by the palpable knowledge that this one principle is the key to the
        atonement of humanity, at <em>Jalan Cinta Sanctuary</em> we come together to practice
        Love.
