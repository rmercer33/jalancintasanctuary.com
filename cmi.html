Christ-Mind that has the capacity, that really has the ability to see Only What Is Real

Now, you must remember here that this is referring to the Christ That You Are,
that you’ve never stopped being, even though you deny it. Your mind is, like we
said last week, the only Mind there is. Mind is a Singularity. There is only
One; that Mind is God; that Mind is gifted by God to every single part of His
Creations; that Mind is the One Conscious Experience of Being Conscious that
you are experiencing. It’s the Christ-Mind because it’s the Mind of God.

Whereas the Christ of You looks at everything and immediately recognizes Itself
in It, lets It in so It can register, let’s everything in so It can register as
the Love that’s being extended, which elicits the Conscious Experience that’s
it the same Love that You Are, that You The Christ Are, and that you are
observing the Love that You Are in expression, in movement, as everything that
you’re seeing.

Now, the equivalent of this, that will also be helpful to you, is for you to
understand that you right now are the Christ, the Christ Mind, the Christ
Consciousness, seeing everything clearly, or through a glass darkly. You’re not
an ego seeing things clearly or through a glass darkly. In other words, you are
the Ultimate right now, experiencing the Ultimateness of you fully, or in a
very limited fashion.

----
If you’re not experiencing Reality, or the Kingdom of Heaven as it is, then at
some point you, as one who was fully Awake and, I will say, fully Christed,
made a choice together with another Christ, and the choice took you into a
fantasy, a daydream, an illusory experience of Reality, and lost your sane
experience of Reality.

Now the moment that happened, what has come to be called the Holy Spirit became
defined, I will put it that way. And I have said before that the Holy Spirit is
your divinity held in trust while you dally with the daydream, while you dally
with this illusory experience of being an ego.
----
So if it is hard for you to believe that you are the Son or Daughter of God,
that you are the Christ, that you are exactly as God created you or exactly as
God is Being you at this moment, if you don’t believe that and you do believe
that you’re just a physical body that came from a sperm and an egg, you will go
with your belief. You will choose what you believe. And so, Waking up is a
matter of changing what you believe.

Waking up amounts to considering the possibility that you are the unbelievable,
that you are what you can’t yet believe. And you must be willing to embrace
that possibility and explore it with vigor and enthusiasm, if for no other
reason than there is the possibility that that might be an even more
interesting experience than the dream you’re dreaming.
----
Now, there you go, the journey ends where it began, which is at Home. And if
any of you still are not clear, you started out this… I’m going to call it an
escapade from Home. You have all been Awake. You were initially and forever the
direct Expression of God, the Christ fully, fully Awakened, until you chose to
indulge in a daydream.

And so your journey Home is a journey back from where you left. And it’s very
valuable to be aware of this because what you think you’re moving toward is not
something you have to achieve. It’s something you have to let yourself back
into. It’s a natural, eternal state of your Being. And what you’re doing is
letting yourself back into it. It’s like the daydreamer in the schoolroom
letting his attention come back to the schoolroom, a place he never left.
----
And what’s left uncovered, what’s left revealed by the absence of the
encumbrances, the extras, is the Christ—You in your actuality, You in your
reality, You in your innocence, You in your purity that was never soiled, no
matter what you thought, You in your inviolability that’s incapable of being
threatened and You inseparable from the Whole, outside of which there is
nothing that could oppose you because there is no outside to Wholeness.

      We live in a time of great change facilitated in large part by
      the world shrinking effect of the Internet that has brought us
      together in a way never before possible. And with that has come
      the awareness of the need for change in the way we treat our
      world, each other, and ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
      Christ Mind teachings offer a profound and surprisingly
      effective approach to making such a change. What they offer is
      not religious and, in the end, not even spiritual but very
      practical, feet on the ground wisdom that provides the clarity
      needed and the strength required to manifest the needed changes
      - in a way that far exceed our wildest imagination.

      of the Internet that has brought us together in a way never before
      possible. And with that has come the awareness of the need for change in the

      us are looking for another way of being.

      <p>
      Central to each of us is an incredible innate essence which
      is already whole. It has been known as the True Self, Authentic Self,
      Transcendental Self, Heart, and Soul. It is the part of us that can
      witness our human mind thinking and the part of us that knows and
      feels when something truly true.

          <strong>
            “The Heart is that which is beyond space and time and is that spark of Light in
            the Mind of God, which is called Christ
            <small><em>Way of the Heart, Lesson 1</em></small>
          </strong>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      Another name for this innate essence, this Heart which abides in perfect
      equality as every one of us, is Christ. Christ, which is who we truly are, never
      ceases to exist in complete unity with the all of Creation, the Mind of God
      even though we may have forgotten or lost conscious awareness of it.

      Christ Mind Teachings are teachings that support us to learn about the purpose
      of the human journey, our humanity, the truth of who we really are, our
      divinity and how to embody it in our everyday lives. They are profound
      mystical wisdoms that span time and space and touch the very core of our
      Being at this time when there is a call, a yearning for another way of
      being. Christ Mind teachings offer a surprisingly effective and very practical
      approach to making the change now desired and needed in a way that far exceeds
      our wildest imagination.
