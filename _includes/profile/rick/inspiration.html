<blockquote class="quote-v2">
  <p>
    What is a dinner party where love is not? It is merely a social obligation. But a dinner party where love is welcomed
    to take its place becomes a celebration. Your table becomes an altar to the Lord and grace is upon it and the Lord
    is with you.
  </p>
  <small><em>A Course of Love</em> c:11.18</small>
