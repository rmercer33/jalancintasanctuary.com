## Who Am I? {#who .h2-prof .margin-bottom-20}

When next someone asks you "Oh, who are you?", please do not give them a name, do not say,

> *Well, I was born in a certain town, in a certain part of the planet.*

Don’t tell them that you are a Democrat, or a Republican, or a communist, or an
atheist, or a Catholic. Tell them the Truth:

> ## Who am I?
>
> *I am the extension of Love in form. I have never been born and
> I will never taste death. I am infinite and eternal. I shine forth as a sunbeam
> to the sun. I am the effect of God’s Love.*
>
> *And, I stand before you to love you.*
>

Beside that &ndash; *as if that were not enough* &ndash; I have extensive technical experience installing,
configuring, developing, and supporting software solutions on projects both large
and small for government and industry.

I support Jalan Cinta Sanctuary through development of the website and technical components of 
other projects.

Please contact me directly if you notice any problems with the website or want to suggest a
great idea for a new website feature or technically related project.
